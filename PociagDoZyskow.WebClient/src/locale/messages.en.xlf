            or other third party payment services. Payments may also be arranged directly with Tournament Organizers.

            the payment service, and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the payment service.

            refunds as required via the Site, payment service, or otherwise. If a General User desires to request a refund, they must 
            request the refund from the Tournament Organizer. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Tournament 
            Organizer and General User initiating payment and The Company will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors 
            in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the Services. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks 
            and refunds are between the Tournament Organizer and General User initiating payment and The Company will not be responsible or 
            liable in any way for chargebacks in connection with a General User’s use of the Services.
